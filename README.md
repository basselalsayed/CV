## Background

<p> 
  Unknowingly, I first started debugging around age 10. Running cracked games was often a multi-step process 
</P>

<p>
During time at Brooks Holdings, was responsible for 5 businesses in 3 industries.

Brooks Holdings was a family office with a startup environment, worked closely with the Founder. Was involved with a diverse range of simultaneous projects. Shown to be a creative problem solver who contributes to his team. I have been thrown into many situations many situations outside of my comfort zone and consistently came out successful.This versatility proved beneficial throughout the Makers bootcamp. 

I decided to switch careers after almost three years at my previous role when I felt the learning had plateued. I thrive in environments with constant challenge and I thouroughly enjoy having found an industry where I can combine my love of tech with creative problem solving on a daily basis.

## Skills

### Teamwork, Leadership and Soft Skills

During my time at Makers my ability to work productively in a team has increased dramatically. Although initially finding difficulty keeping my teammates in constant consideration under the pressure of a deadline, I learned patience and that I equally enjoy following as well as leading. I have strong, empathy and communiction skills that allow me to challenge my team and share ideas in a comfortable, non-confrontational manner. These skills transfer to managerial, presentational and client facing scenarios. I have a passion for sharing knowledge, and I enjoy helping and showing others what I have learned. I had two mentees while at Makers.


### Adaptability

While growing up I lived in different environments, in my work life I frequently faced new and unexpected challenges. I have excelled in many of these situations thanks to my growth mindset, creativity and deciveness. For our final project, we learned enough python, django, react, circleci, jest, webpack/babel to have a successful launch in two weeks. My experience shows I have the capability to survive and thrive in any work environment regardless of language experience and contribute to any team. 


### Problem Solving, Fast Learner

Unknowingly, I've spent much of my life trying to automate and improve systems around me. This transfers to project work where I aim to learn and understand as much as possible to gain perspective and avoid future bugs. An example of this was when learning Ruby on Rails on our Acebook project, much of the project is auto generated. When presented with the option of more auto generation for the user authentication; I put forward to my team that we should build from scratch for fear of not understanding what was happening under the hood with more new technology. Despite a day and a half of frustration the decision paid off as we gained more flexibility with our custom model.

### Motivated

The idea of Silicon Valley, tech billionaires, fast cars and faster women are not the reasons I got into software development. Although there is financial incentive in this industry. I believe it chose me because problem solving to this capacity, with all the intricacies and possibilities when planning out a project, the pros and cons of different approaches, thinking multiple steps ahead as well as the ability to clearly communicate abstract ideas are qualities I possess and enjoy exercising. My motivation is internal, and I want to get the most out of this journey. 


## Education

12 week intensive coding bootcamp in which covered many industry best practices:

- Practices: OOP, TDD, Agile, MVC, Agile/XP
- Languagues: Ruby, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS
- Test suites: RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, Jest

#### Aberystwyth University (September 2012 to June 2016)

- Economics BSc
- 3rd Class
- For my dissertation I analyzed the 2008 recession from a different perspective to what are widely attributed as the main causes. The economic mindset of opportunity cost and evaluating options has been key to my approach as a developer. 


## Experience

**Brooks Holdings Ltd** (June 2016 to March 2019)    
*Operations Manager*  
- While at this private family office, was responsible for 5 businesses in 3 industries.
- Small staff meant I had to coordinate well with others, and logistically plan out how to maintain operations.
- High level of responsibility. Had to learn how to manage and train others, negotiate, find new business, write a business plan, budget, forecast, operations (accounting, legal, compliance, public relations) and schedule in a short period of time. It has contributed to my resilience and ability to work under pressure, juggle multiple balls.
