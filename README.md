## Background

<p> 
  Unknowingly, I first started debugging around age 10. Running cracked games was often a multi-step process 
</P>

<p>
During time at Brooks Holdings, was responsible for 5 businesses in 3 industries.

Brooks Holdings was a family office with a startup environment, worked closely with the Founder. Was involved with a diverse range of simultaneous projects. Shown to be a creative problem solver who contributes to his team. I have been thrown into many situations many situations outside of my comfort zone and consistently came out successful. This versatility proved beneficial throughout the Makers bootcamp.

I decided to switch careers after almost three years at my previous role when I felt the learning had plateaued. I thrive in environments with constant challenge and I'm happy I found an industry where I can combine my love of tech with creative problem solving on a daily basis.

## Skills

### Teamwork, Leadership and Soft Skills

During my time at Makers my ability to work productively in a team has increased dramatically. Although initially finding difficulty keeping my teammates in constant consideration under the pressure of a deadline, I learned patience and that I equally enjoy following as well as leading. I have strong empathy and communication skills that allow me to challenge my team and share ideas in a comfortable, non-confrontational manner. These skills transfer to managerial, presentational and client facing scenarios. I have a passion for sharing knowledge, and I enjoy helping and showing others what I have learned. I had two mentees while at Makers.

### Adaptability

While growing up I lived in different environments, in my work life I frequently faced new and unexpected challenges. I have excelled in many of these situations thanks to my growth mindset, creativity and decisiveness. For our final project, we learned enough python, django, react, circleci, jest, webpack/babel to have a successful launch in two weeks. My experience shows I have the capability to survive and thrive in any work environment regardless of language experience and contribute to any team.

### Problem Solving, Fast Learner

Unknowingly, I've spent much of my life trying to automate and improve systems around me. This transfers to project work where I aim to learn and understand as much as possible to gain perspective and avoid future bugs. An example of this was when learning Ruby on Rails on our [Acebook](https://github.com/basselalsayed/acebook-derailed) project, much of the project is auto generated. When presented with the option of more auto generation for the user authentication; I put forward to my team that we should build from scratch for fear of not understanding what was happening under the hood with more new technology. Despite a day and a half of frustration the decision paid off as we gained more flexibility with our custom model.

### Motivated

Although there is financial incentive in this industry. I am here because I enjoy the whole process; from the various considerations when mapping out a project, inevitably being forced to think up creative workarounds or learn a new library because it provides what is needed to the satisfaction of seeing an end product that provides a quality service to users. My motivation is internal, one of my current goals is to improve to a point I can contribute back to the developer community (by making a pull request to a major codebase or releasing a tool that could help others). I want to work in environments with fellow developers who are as passionate about engineering as I am.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (December 2019 - March 2020)

12 week intensive coding bootcamp in which covered many industry best practices:

- Practices: OOP, TDD, Agile, MVC, Agile/XP
- Languages: Ruby, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS
- Test suites: RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, Jest
- Frameworks: Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, Django, React.js
- Other: Heroku, TravisCI

#### Aberystwyth University (September 2012 to June 2016)

- Economics BSc
- 3rd Class
- For my dissertation I analyzed the 2008 recession from a different perspective to what are widely attributed as the main causes. The economic mindset of opportunity cost and evaluating options has been key to my approach as a developer.

## Experience

**Brooks Holdings Ltd** (June 2016 to March 2019)  
_Operations Manager_

- While at this private family office, was responsible for 5 businesses in 3 industries.
- Small staff meant I had to coordinate well with others, and logistically plan out how to maintain operations.
- High level of responsibility. Had to learn how to manage and train others, negotiate, find new business, write a business plan, budget, forecast, operations (accounting, legal, compliance, public relations) and schedule in a short period of time with minimal supervision or formal resources. It has contributed to my resilience and ability to work under pressure, juggle multiple balls.

## Interests

Exercise, guitar, tennis, ping pong, bouldering, yoga, boxing
