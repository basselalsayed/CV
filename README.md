## Skills

Teamwork and Soft Skills

During my time at Makers my ability to work productively in a team has increased dramatically. Although initially finding difficulty keeping my teammates in constant consideration (coordinating with others?) under the pressure of a deadline, I learned patience and that I equally enjoy following as well as leading. I have strong, empathy and communiction skills that allow me to challenge my team and share ideas in a comfortable, non-confrontational manner while paying attention to my team's needs at that time. I have a passion for sharing knowledge, and I enjoy helping and showing others what I have learned. I had two mentees while at Makers.

Leadership

Adaptability

While growing up I lived in different environments, in my work experience I frequently faced new and unexpected challenges. I have excelled in many of these situations due to my growth mindset, creativity and deciveness. For our final project, we learned python, django, react, circleci, jest, webpack/babel in two weeks. My experience shows I have the capability to survive and thrive in any work environment and contribute to any team. 


Problem Solving, Fast Learner

Unknowingly, I've spent much of my life trying to automate and improve systems around me. When working on a project I take it upon myself to learn and understand as much as possible to gain perspective and more importantly avoid future bugs. An example of this was when learning Ruby on Rails on our Acebook project, much of the application is auto generated, I insisted to my team that we should set up the User authentication from scratch for fear of not understanding what was happening under the hood when using more auto-generation with a new technology. Despite a day and a half of frustration the decision paid off for future projects as using the generator is now straightforward. 

Motivated

The idea of Silicon Valley, tech billionaire, fast cars and faster women are not the reasons I got into software development. Although there is financial incentive in this industry. I believe it chose me because problem solving to this capacity, with all the intricacies and possibilities when planning out a project, the pros and cons of different approaches, thinking multiple steps ahead as well as the ability to clearly communicate abstract ideas are qualities I possess and enjoy using. My motivation is internal, and I want to get the most out of this journey. 


## Education

#### Makers Academy (December 2019 - March 2020)
12 week intensive coding bootcamp in which covered many industry best practices:

- Practices: OOP, TDD, Agile, MVC, Agile/XP
- Languagues: Ruby, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS
- Test suites: RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine
- Frameworks: Ruby on Rails, Sinatra
- Other: Heroku, TravisCI
  
#### Aberystwyth University (September 2012 to June 2016)

- Economics BSc
- 3rd Class
- For my dissertation I analyzed the 2008 recession from a different perspective to what are widely attributed as the main causes. The economic mindset of opportunity cost and considering options has been key to my approach as a developer. 


## Experience

**Brooks Holdings Ltd** (June 2016 to March 2019)    
*Operations Manager*  
- While at this private family office, was responsible for 5 businesses in 3 industries.
- Small staff meant I had to coordinate well with others, and logistically plan out how to maintain operations.
- High level of responsibility meant I had to learn how to manage others, negotiate, find new business, budget, forecast, train, operations(accounting, legal, compliance, public relations), scheduling in a short period of time. It has contributed to my resilience and ability to work under pressure, juggle multiple balls.
 
## Hobbies
